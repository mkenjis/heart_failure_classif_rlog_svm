# heart_failure_classification
heart failure classification using MLlib
- Source : Kaggle Dataset
- URL : https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data

# Purpose: 
- use heart failure dataset to train different classification regression models from MLlib.
- use trained model to identify which ones have a better performance.
		 
# Requirements: 
- Spark installed

# Objective :
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to a classification regression models.
- use different parameters and transformations on data to identify a good model.
- demonstrate different approaches using MLlib libraries.
